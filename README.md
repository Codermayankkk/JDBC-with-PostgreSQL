# Java CRUD Operations with PostgreSQL

This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Java, 
interfacing with a PostgreSQL database. It focuses on managing data in an emp table, 
showcasing the fundamental aspects of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with PostgreSQL.

Key Features

Database Connection: Utilizes the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to establish a robust connection between Java and PostgreSQL.

CRUD Operations: Implements all four basic database operations:

Create: Insert new employee records

Read: Retrieve and display employee data

Update: Modify existing employee information

Delete: Remove employee records from the database

Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of Java-PostgreSQL integration, ideal for:

Developers new to JDBC concepts
Those looking to understand database operations in Java
Anyone seeking a foundation for building more complex database-driven applications

By exploring this codebase, you'll gain insights into the essential components of Java database connectivity and how to perform basic data manipulation tasks using SQL within a Java environment.
